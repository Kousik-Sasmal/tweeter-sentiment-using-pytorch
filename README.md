# Tweeter Sentiment Analysis using `TorchText` and `PyTorch`

I have made a sentiment analysis model using `TorchText` and `pytorch`, and accuracy of the model was above 90%. 
Dataset link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis.

Initially, all experiment done in `Jupyter notebook` environment, that is within `notebooks` folder. After that, all the codes are written in `src` folder. 

Files, generated during data processing and model building, are saved within `artifacts` folder. 
Codes related `streamlit` web app written in `app.py` file.


Skill Used:

1) Python/OOPs
2) Numpy and Pandas
3) PyTorch and torchtext
4) RNN/LSTM
5) Regularization
6) Modular coding approach
7) Streamlit

### Google Colab notebook link for this repository 
Note: If you do not have GPU in your machine, you are encouraged to run the code on Google Colab (link given below).

### Experiment with Torchtext of PyTorch 
If you are a beginner, and want to experiment with `Torchtext`, here is another repository Link https://github.com/Kousik-Sasmal/experiment-with-pytorch-torchtext.
